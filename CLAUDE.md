# Coffee, Code n' Kobolds

Browser-based virtual tabletop for playing D&D Lite. Desktop browsers only — no mobile layouts, no
SSR, no SEO.

Spec: [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md). Decisions: [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Branching — always work on a branch

**Never commit directly to `dev` or `main`.**

```
feature/xyz ──┐
              ├──▶ dev ──(pull request)──▶ main
  fix/abc  ───┘
```

- Branch from `dev` for every change, however small.
- Prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`.
- Merge the branch into `dev` when it's complete and working.
- `main` only ever receives changes via pull request from `dev`. GitHub rejects direct pushes.

Commit messages: short imperative subject (`Add initiative tracker to DM panel`). Use the body to
explain *why* when the diff doesn't make it obvious.

## Stack

React + TypeScript + Vite (static SPA, **hash routing**) · Convex (database, realtime, file storage)
· react-konva (map canvas) · @3d-dice/dice-box · Tailwind + shadcn/ui · GitHub Pages via Actions.

Rationale and rejected alternatives: [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-platform-and-hosting.md).

## Invariants — easy to get wrong, expensive to get wrong

1. **Filter DM-only data server-side, inside Convex queries.** This repo is public and the client
   bundle is readable. DM layer contents must never be sent to player clients, and exact NPC hit
   points must never be sent to players — send a percentage for the health bar instead. Hiding
   either in the client is not security.
2. **Don't write token positions to the database on every mouse-move.** Render drags locally,
   throttle writes to ~10/sec, commit on drop. Use Convex optimistic updates so it feels instant.
3. **Hash routing only** (`/#/game/ABC123`). GitHub Pages has no rewrite rules, so a browser-path
   deep link 404s on refresh.
4. **Vite needs `base: '/coffee-code-n-kobolds/'`.** The site is served from a subpath; omitting
   this breaks asset loading in confusing ways.
5. **Characters live inside the game document**, not against a player identity — see
   [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-defer-user-accounts.md). There are no user accounts in v1; players join
   with a game code and a display name.
6. **Keep uploads small.** Convex free tier gives 1 GB of file storage for maps, tokens, modal
   images and music. Downscale images on upload.

## Rules scope

D&D Lite is a deliberately reduced subset of 5e (2024). Before adding a rules feature, check
[docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) — things like racial abilities, background skills,
inventory and movement-impairing conditions are **excluded by design**, not missing.

## Commands

None yet — the project is not scaffolded. This section gets filled in by the scaffolding branch.
